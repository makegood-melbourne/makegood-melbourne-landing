WHAT IS A MAKE GOOD?
A make good (also known as "reinstatement" or "restoration") refers to the process of returning a commercial property to its original condition when your lease ends. This obligation is typically outlined in your commercial lease agreement under the "make good clause" or "reinstatement provisions."

Make good typically includes:
- Demolition & Removal: Removing tenant-installed partitions, stripping out fitouts, signage removal, pallet racking dismantling
- Restoration Works: Patching holes, repainting, ceiling tile replacement, floor restoration
- Electrical & Services: Make safe and isolation, data cabling removal, compliance certificates
- Final Works: Detailed cleaning, documentation, landlord inspection coordination

Make good costs in Melbourne typically range from:
- Standard Make Good: $100-$200 per square metre (cleaning, minor repairs, painting)
- Full Reinstatement: $250-$350+ per square metre (complete strip-out, full restoration)

OUR 6-STEP PROCESS (for end-of-lease make goods):
1. Consultation - We review your lease, inspect your premises and discuss requirements. No obligation.
2. Detailed Quote - Comprehensive, itemised quote with no hidden fees.
3. Scope Agreement - We work with you and landlord to finalise scope. We can attend meetings on your behalf.
4. Scheduled Works - Our licensed team completes all works, coordinating all trades.
5. Quality Inspection - Thorough internal inspection before landlord handover. Defects rectified immediately.
6. Handover & Sign-off - We coordinate final landlord inspection. Your bond is protected.

Note: This process is for end-of-lease make good projects. For simpler works (cleaning, minor repairs) or specialist services (structural remediation, cladding), we offer a streamlined approach.
