+        answer: "Flooring reinstatement is the process of restoring a commercial or industrial property’s floor to its original condition as required by an end-of-lease agreement. This is different from replacement as it focuses on repairing and preparing the existing concrete slab, rather than installing a new floor covering. The process typically involves removing old flooring, repairing any damage, and ensuring the surface is clean, safe, and compliant.",
+      },
+      {
+        question: "How much does flooring reinstatement cost?",
+        answer: "The cost of flooring reinstatement varies depending on the size of the area, the condition of the concrete slab, and the specific requirements of your lease agreement. We provide a detailed, fixed-price quote after a thorough site inspection, so you have complete certainty of the costs involved before we begin.",
+      },
+      {
+        question: "How long does the process take?",
+        answer: "We understand that end-of-lease projects are time-sensitive. A typical flooring reinstatement project can be completed in just 2-4 days, depending on the scope of work. We work efficiently to ensure you meet your handover deadline without fail.",
+      },
+      {
+        question: "What types of damage can you repair?",
+        answer: "Our team is equipped to handle all common forms of concrete slab damage, including filling cracks and expansion joints, repairing spalling or chipped concrete, and grinding down uneven surfaces. We also specialize in filling in bolt-holes left from pallet racking or other machinery to create a perfectly smooth and safe surface.",
+      },
+      {
+        question: "How long will the reinstated floor last?",
+        answer: "A properly reinstated concrete floor is incredibly durable and designed to last for many years under normal industrial or commercial use. The goal of reinstatement is to return the slab to a robust, baseline condition that will stand the test of time for the next tenant.",
