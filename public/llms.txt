We are Melbourne's end-of-lease make good specialists, delivering precise, compliant and on-time strip out and restoration services for office, retail and warehouse properties.

## Strip Out Services

### Overview
Preparing a commercial or industrial space for its next chapter requires more than just demolition. It demands precision, safety and a deep understanding of lease obligations. Our expert strip out and 'back to base' services for office, retail and warehouse properties across Melbourne ensure your project is completed on time, on budget and ready for handover.

### What is "Back to Base" or "Make Good"?
A 'back to base' provision is a clause in most commercial leases that requires a tenant to return the property to its original condition at the end of the lease term. This typically involves removing all partitions, fixtures, data cabling and other additions, and making good any damage to the base building.

### Strip Out vs Standard Demolition
A commercial strip out is a form of selective, internal demolition. Unlike a full building demolition, the goal is to carefully remove internal elements without damaging the base building's structure, essential services or surrounding tenancies. It requires precision, planning and a deep understanding of live environments.

### Our Strip Out Services Include:
1. Make Safe Works (Back to Base disconnection)
2. Demolition Works (Internal strip-outs)
3. Pallet Racking Removal

## Make Safe Works (Back to Base Disconnection)

### Overview
We disconnect and make safe all building services for your end-of-lease make good, returning all cabling back to base with full certification.

### What We Do
As part of your end-of-lease make good works, all building services need to be properly disconnected with all cabling returned back to base. We handle the complete disconnection of electrical, plumbing and HVAC systems. All certificates of completed works are provided upon handover.

We work within your project timeline, coordinating with our demolition crew throughout the entire strip out. From initial disconnection through to final certification, we manage the process to keep your make good on schedule.

### Fire Services

### After-Hours Work
Yes. We can schedule disconnections outside business hours or on weekends to meet your project deadlines and minimize disruption to other tenants in the building.

### Certifications
We provide certificates of completed works for all electrical, plumbing and HVAC disconnections. These certificates are required for your lease handover and are included with every project.

- Internal doors and frames
- Suspended ceilings and grids
- Removal of fixtures and fittings

### Our Approach
We approach every strip-out with a clear plan of works designed to meet your end-of-lease obligations on schedule. By coordinating directly with building management, we ensure a smooth process that fulfills all lease requirements without delays or complications.

Our expertise extends beyond offices and warehouses to include retail, hospitality and medical centres. We are licensed, insured and have the capability to work after hours to avoid disrupting adjacent tenants. This thorough planning allows us to identify challenges early, delivering a successful handover with no surprise variations.

### Live Environment Work
Yes. We specialise in projects within live environments. Our team implements strict dust control measures, manages noise levels and schedules work to minimise disruption to your ongoing business operations or adjacent tenants.

### Hazardous Materials
We manage all waste generated from the demolition process, including general construction debris (drywall, timber), concrete, scrap metal (which we segregate for recycling) and flooring materials. We are also equipped to manage the certified disposal of hazardous materials including asbestos through our specialist partners.

### Is Demolition Always Required?
Not always, but it is a common requirement in most commercial lease agreements. The goal of a make good is to return the space to its original base condition, which typically involves removing all non-original partitions, fixtures and fittings. Our demolition service is specifically designed to handle this deconstruction phase of the end-of-lease process efficiently and correctly.

## Pallet Racking Removal

### Overview
Whether you are reconfiguring your warehouse, relocating or preparing for handover, the removal of pallet racking must be done correctly. We don't just dismantle; we restore the concrete slab to a safe, clean condition. This means every anchor is core-drilled and removed, the void is filled with high-strength epoxy resin and the repair is ground flush to restore your warehouse floor.

### Capabilities

#### System Dismantling
- All types of racking systems
- Mezzanine floor removal
- Removal of bollards and guard rails
- Safe, methodical process

#### Concrete Slab Restoration
- Core-drilling of all anchors
- High-strength epoxy filling
- Surface grinding for a flush finish
- Crack and chip repairs

#### Logistics & Recovery
- Stacking, banding and transport
- Full site clean-up and waste disposal
- Purchase offers for used racking
- Detailed project documentation

### Our Approach
The removal of industrial racking involves significant logistical and safety challenges. An unprofessional approach can lead to more than just a poor-quality floor repair; it can result in safety incidents, damage to the building's structure or loading docks and failure to meet the strict deadlines of a lease agreement.

We manage all site logistics and work to your project's deadlines. Our end-to-end service includes the complete removal of the racking from your site—be it for disposal, resale or relocation. We then restore the concrete slab to its original condition for handover.

### Racking Types
We are equipped to dismantle and remove all common types of industrial and warehouse racking, including selective, double-deep, drive-in, push-back, pallet-flow, cantilever and mezzanine floor systems.

### Floor Restoration
Yes. Our service includes the complete removal of all anchors. We then fill the holes with high-strength epoxy resin and grind the repairs flush to leave a clean, safe and compliant floor.

### Used Racking Purchase
Yes, in many cases. If your racking is a standard size and in good, reusable condition, we can offer a competitive purchase price. This can be used as a credit to significantly reduce or even eliminate the cost of the removal works.

### Timeline
The timeline depends on the quantity and type of racking. A small warehouse can often be cleared in a single day, while a large-scale distribution centre may take a week or more. We provide a clear and reliable timeline for every project.
