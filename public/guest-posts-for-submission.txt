**Title:** Understanding Make Good Clauses: What Every Commercial Contractor Should Know
**Author:** The Make Good Melbourne Team
**Word count:** ~850

---

At the end of a commercial lease, one clause often catches tenants off guard: the make good clause. For contractors working in commercial fit-outs and refurbishments, understanding these obligations is essential—not just for your clients but for positioning your services strategically.

### What Is a Make Good Clause?

A make good clause requires tenants to return leased premises to a specified condition upon lease expiry. This might mean restoring the space to its original state, removing all fixtures and partitions or simply ensuring the property meets an agreed standard.

The scope varies significantly between leases. Some require a complete strip-out back to base building, while others accept the space "as is" with minor repairs. The distinction can mean tens of thousands of dollars difference in exit costs.

### Why Contractors Need to Understand Make Good

If you're involved in commercial construction, understanding make good requirements creates opportunities:

**During fit-out projects:** Advising clients on how their modifications will affect future make good obligations builds trust and positions you as a knowledgeable partner rather than just a service provider.

**At lease end:** Make good works represent a significant market segment. Office strip-outs, warehouse restorations and retail de-fits all require skilled contractors who understand both demolition and remediation.

**Documentation matters:** Photographing and documenting the original condition before any fit-out protects everyone. Contractors who implement this practice demonstrate professionalism that clients remember.

### Common Make Good Requirements

Typical make good works include:

- Removal of internal partitions, glass walls and joinery
- Patching and repainting walls to match existing finishes
- Ceiling tile replacement and grid repairs
- Floor covering removal and substrate preparation
- Electrical and data cabling removal back to distribution boards
- HVAC modifications reversed to base building configuration
- Signage removal and facade restoration

The complexity increases with the original fit-out scope. A basic office with minimal modifications might require two days of work. A heavily customised space with mezzanines, specialised electrical systems or structural alterations could take weeks.

### The Contractor's Role in Lease Negotiations

Smart tenants involve contractors early—sometimes before signing a lease. A walkthrough with an experienced [make good contractor](https://makegood.melbourne) can identify potential issues:

- Existing damage that should be documented and excluded from future make good obligations
- Building elements that may be difficult or expensive to restore
- Opportunities to negotiate a reduced make good scope

This advisory role builds long-term client relationships and often leads to both the initial fit-out contract and the eventual make good works.

### Timing Considerations

Make good works typically must be completed before lease expiry, meaning tenants need to vacate early enough to allow for the work. Underestimating this timeline is one of the most common and costly mistakes.

For contractors, this creates scheduling challenges. Make good projects often come with fixed deadlines and penalty clauses for delays. Building relationships with reliable subcontractors and maintaining flexibility in your schedule during peak lease-end periods (typically December and June) positions you to capture this work.

### Quality Standards and Disputes

Disagreements between landlords and tenants over make good quality are common. As a contractor, your role includes:

- Understanding what "reasonable wear and tear" means in practice
- Documenting your work thoroughly
- Managing client expectations about achievable outcomes
- Knowing when perfection isn't required—and when it is

Experienced contractors recognise that the goal is meeting lease obligations, not exceeding them unnecessarily. This balanced approach keeps projects profitable while satisfying all parties.

### Building Your Make Good Expertise

Contractors looking to expand into make good services should consider:

- Familiarising yourself with common commercial lease terms
- Developing relationships with commercial property managers
- Building capability in both demolition and remediation
- Understanding hazardous materials requirements (particularly asbestos in older buildings)
- Investing in appropriate insurance coverage

The commercial make good market in Australia remains strong, driven by ongoing lease cycles and changing business space requirements. Contractors who develop genuine expertise in this area find consistent demand for their services.

**Title:** Make Good Obligations: What Landlords Should Expect from Tenants
**Author:** The Make Good Melbourne Team
**Word count:** ~800

---

When a commercial lease ends, the make good clause determines how the property returns to your control. For landlords, understanding these obligations—and enforcing them appropriately—protects your asset and minimises vacancy periods between tenants.

### Defining Make Good in Your Lease

The strength of your make good position depends entirely on lease drafting. Vague language creates disputes; specific requirements create clarity.

Effective make good clauses specify:

- The exact condition required (original state, base building, or agreed standard)
- Which elements must be removed versus retained
- Quality standards for repairs and finishes
- Timeline requirements and access arrangements
- Consequences for non-compliance

Many landlords inherit leases with poorly defined make good terms. While you cannot change existing agreements, understanding their limitations helps you manage expectations and plan accordingly.

### Pre-Lease Documentation

The most valuable thing any landlord can do is document the property's condition before a tenant takes possession. This includes:

- Professional photography of all areas
- Written descriptions of finishes, fixtures and condition
- Video walkthrough for comprehensive coverage
- Notes on existing damage or wear

This documentation becomes invaluable when assessing make good compliance. Without it, disputes become subjective rather than factual.

### What Reasonable Make Good Looks Like

Make good does not mean brand new. The standard is typically returning the premises to the documented original condition, accounting for reasonable wear and tear.

Reasonable expectations include:

- Walls patched and painted to match existing (not necessarily perfect colour matching throughout)
- Flooring in equivalent condition to original (replacement if damaged, cleaning if simply worn)
- Ceilings functional with matching tiles (minor variations acceptable)
- All tenant fixtures, equipment and cabling removed
- Services functional and compliant

Unreasonable expectations—demanding upgrades beyond original condition or refusing to accept industry-standard finishes—create costly disputes and delay re-leasing.

### Managing the Make Good Process

Successful make good outcomes require landlord involvement:

**Early communication:** Contact tenants 6-12 months before lease expiry to discuss make good expectations. This allows time for planning and prevents last-minute surprises.

**Scope agreement:** Walk through the premises together and agree on specific requirements in writing. Where possible, provide a detailed scope of works.

**Progress inspections:** For significant make good projects, schedule inspections during the work rather than only at completion. This catches issues early when they are cheaper to fix.

**Final inspection:** Allow adequate time for snagging and remediation before the tenant's deadline. A rushed final inspection benefits no one.

### When Tenants Cannot or Will Not Comply

Despite clear obligations, some tenants fail to complete make good works. Your options include:

**Cash settlement:** Negotiating a payment in lieu of works can be faster and simpler than enforcement. Obtain quotes from [commercial make good specialists](https://makegood.melbourne) to establish fair value.

**Bond claims:** Security deposits exist partly for this purpose, though they rarely cover full make good costs for significant fit-outs.

**Legal action:** Pursuing tenants for make good costs is possible but time-consuming and expensive. The commercial relationship and tenant's financial position determine whether this is worthwhile.

### Balancing Enforcement and Relationships

Aggressive make good enforcement can damage your reputation in the commercial property market. Tenants talk, and property managers share experiences.

The most successful landlords find the balance: clear expectations, reasonable standards, professional communication and willingness to negotiate where appropriate. This approach protects your asset while maintaining the relationships that drive future leasing success.

### Preparing for the Next Tenant

Make good works present an opportunity to assess your property's market position. While the outgoing tenant covers restoration to original condition, you might choose to invest in upgrades that improve leasing prospects:

- Updated common area finishes
- Improved lighting or energy efficiency
- Enhanced accessibility features
- Fresh base building presentation

Coordinating these improvements with make good works minimises disruption and vacancy time.

# POST 3: Smart Strata
**Submit to:** https://smartstrata.com/collaboration/
**Title:** End of Lease Make Good in Strata Buildings: A Guide for Owners and Managers
**Author:** The Make Good Melbourne Team
**Word count:** ~850

---

Commercial tenancies within strata buildings add complexity to the make good process. Body corporate rules, shared infrastructure and multiple stakeholders all influence how lease-end restorations should be managed.

### Make Good Within Strata: Key Differences

Unlike standalone commercial buildings, strata properties involve shared ownership and collective decision-making. This affects make good works in several ways:

**Common property boundaries:** Tenants may have modified elements that cross into common property—signage, services penetrations or structural attachments. Restoring these requires body corporate involvement.

**Access and timing:** Make good works may require access to common areas, affect other lot owners or generate noise and disruption. Coordination with strata management is essential.

**Approvals and compliance:** Original fit-out works should have received body corporate approval. Make good works returning the space to original condition generally do not require fresh approval, but any variations might.

**Insurance considerations:** Works within strata buildings must comply with building insurance requirements. Contractors need appropriate coverage, and certain works may require notification to insurers.

### The Lot Owner's Responsibilities

When a tenancy ends, the lot owner bears ultimate responsibility for make good outcomes—regardless of what the lease says. If a tenant fails to complete required works, the lot owner must remedy the situation.

This responsibility includes:

- Ensuring works comply with body corporate by-laws
- Managing contractor access and behaviour within the building
- Addressing any damage to common property caused during works
- Certifying completion to the body corporate if required

Smart lot owners build make good requirements into their leases and maintain relationships with reliable [make good contractors in Melbourne](https://makegood.melbourne) who understand strata environments.

### Common Issues in Strata Make Good

**Services modifications:** Commercial tenants often upgrade electrical, data and air conditioning systems. Returning these to original configuration can affect building-wide systems and requires careful coordination.

**Structural changes:** Mezzanine floors, internal stairs and partition walls may have involved structural work. Removal requires engineering input and potentially certification.

**Fire safety compliance:** Any works affecting fire compartmentation, egress or safety systems must maintain compliance. This is non-negotiable in strata buildings.

**Waste removal:** Commercial strip-outs generate significant waste. Building loading docks, lifts and common areas need protection and scheduling.

**After-hours requirements:** Many strata buildings restrict noisy works to specific hours. Make good timelines must account for these limitations.

### Strata Manager Involvement

Body corporate managers play a crucial role in smooth make good outcomes:

**Pre-work notification:** Informing other lot owners and occupants about upcoming works maintains good relationships and reduces complaints.

**Contractor induction:** Many strata buildings require contractor registration, insurance verification and site-specific safety briefings.

**Access coordination:** Managing lift bookings, loading dock schedules and common area protection.

**Defect identification:** Spotting any damage to common property during or after works and ensuring prompt rectification.

**Documentation:** Recording the completed make good for body corporate records.

### Best Practice for Lot Owners

Protect your investment and maintain positive strata relationships:

**Document thoroughly:** Before leasing, photograph and describe your lot's condition. Include any common property interfaces or shared elements.

**Lease carefully:** Ensure make good clauses are specific and enforceable. Include provisions for body corporate compliance and access requirements.

**Communicate early:** Alert your strata manager when tenancies are ending. Discuss timing, access needs and any potential common property impacts.

**Use experienced contractors:** Engage contractors who have worked in strata environments and understand the additional requirements. Inexperienced operators can damage common property, upset other occupants and create liability issues.

**Inspect before tenant departure:** Don't wait until the tenant has left to discover incomplete or substandard make good works. Early inspection allows issues to be addressed while the tenant is still responsible.

### When Disputes Arise

Make good disputes in strata settings can involve multiple parties: tenant, lot owner, body corporate and potentially other lot owners affected by the works.

Resolution options include:

- Direct negotiation between parties
- Strata dispute resolution processes
- Mediation through relevant state bodies
- Legal action as a last resort

Most disputes arise from poor communication or unclear expectations. Investing time in documentation and early discussions prevents the majority of conflicts.

### The Bigger Picture

Well-managed make good processes benefit everyone in a strata building. Properties with professional, consistent approaches to commercial tenancy transitions maintain their value and attract quality tenants.

Lot owners who take make good seriously, engage professional contractors and work collaboratively with their body corporate contribute to buildings that everyone is proud to be part of.

# POST 4: Body Corporate Cleaning Melbourne
**Submit to:** https://bodycorporatecleaningmelbourne.com.au/write-for-us/
**Title:** Post-Tenancy Deep Cleaning vs Make Good: Understanding the Difference
**Author:** The Make Good Melbourne Team
**Word count:** ~750

---

When a commercial tenant vacates, property owners often wonder: do I need a deep clean, make good works, or both? Understanding the distinction helps you budget accurately and engage the right professionals.

### Defining the Terms

**Deep cleaning** involves intensive cleaning beyond regular maintenance: carpet shampooing, tile scrubbing, window washing inside and out, kitchen and bathroom sanitisation, and removing accumulated grime from all surfaces.

**Make good** is the broader process of returning premises to their original or agreed condition. This typically includes structural restoration, repairs, repainting and potentially significant demolition or construction work.

In most commercial lease exits, both are required—but they serve different purposes and involve different contractors.

### When Deep Cleaning Is Enough

Sometimes, professional cleaning is all that's needed:

**Short-term tenancies:** A tenant who occupied a space for 12-24 months with minimal modifications may only need thorough cleaning to meet lease requirements.

**Already-fitted spaces:** When tenants move into pre-fitted offices and make no significant changes, restoration to original condition means cleaning rather than construction.

**Clear lease terms:** Some leases specifically require only cleaning at exit, with make good limited to damage repair.

**Agreed variations:** Landlords and tenants sometimes negotiate cleaning-only exits, particularly when incoming tenants plan immediate modifications anyway.

In these situations, engaging a commercial cleaning specialist delivers the required outcome efficiently.

### When Make Good Is Required

Most commercial leases—particularly for longer tenancies or customised fit-outs—require substantive make good works:

**Partition removal:** Internal walls, glass partitions and built joinery must be demolished and removed.

**Surface restoration:** Walls need patching, filling and repainting. Floors may need covering removal and substrate repair.

**Services reinstatement:** Electrical, data, plumbing and HVAC modifications reversed to base building configuration.

**Ceiling work:** Damaged or modified ceiling tiles replaced, grid repairs completed.

**Fixture removal:** All tenant equipment, signage and installations removed.

This work requires [specialist make good contractors](https://makegood.melbourne) with construction capabilities, not cleaning services.

### The Overlap Zone

Here's where confusion occurs: make good contracts often include cleaning as a final step, but cleaning contracts rarely include make good works.

A typical make good project sequence:

1. Strip-out and demolition
2. Removal of waste materials
3. Repairs and restoration
4. Painting and finishing
5. Final clean (builder's clean)
6. Optional: professional deep clean to presentation standard

That final deep clean ensures the space presents well for landlord inspection and incoming tenant viewing. It removes construction dust, marks from tradesperson traffic and any remaining debris.

### Choosing the Right Approach

Ask yourself:

**What does the lease require?** Read the make good clause carefully. Terms like "original condition," "base building" or "strip-out" indicate construction work. Terms like "clean and tidy" or "broom clean" suggest cleaning focus.

**What modifications were made?** A tenant who installed partitions, modified services or made structural changes needs make good work regardless of lease language.

**What condition is the space in?** Damaged walls, worn floors and modified services need restoration, not just cleaning.

**What does the landlord expect?** Direct conversation often clarifies requirements better than lease interpretation alone.

### Coordinating Both Services

For most commercial lease exits, you'll need both services. Coordination matters:

**Sequence correctly:** Make good works must complete before final cleaning. Running these in parallel wastes money as construction work undoes cleaning efforts.

**Communicate clearly:** Ensure your make good contractor knows whether they're providing final cleaning or you're engaging separate cleaners.

**Inspect between stages:** Check make good completion before cleaners begin. Identify any defects that need rectification before the final clean masks them.

**Budget appropriately:** Factor both services into lease exit planning. Underestimating either creates budget pressure at a time when delays are costly.

### Professional Standards

Whether engaging cleaners or make good specialists, look for:

- Commercial property experience
- Appropriate insurance coverage
- Clear scope documentation
- References from similar projects
- Realistic timelines
- Transparent pricing

Both industries have operators ranging from excellent to inadequate. Investing time in selection pays dividends in outcomes.

**Subject line:** guest post for Unlock Real Estate
**Title:** Commercial Lease Exit Costs: Planning Your Make Good Budget
**Author:** The Make Good Melbourne Team
**Word count:** ~800

---

Exiting a commercial lease involves more costs than many tenants anticipate. The make good obligation—returning premises to original or agreed condition—often represents the largest single expense. Smart planning prevents budget shocks and protects your business.

### Why Make Good Costs Surprise Tenants

Several factors contribute to budget surprises:

**Out of sight, out of mind:** Make good obligations sit dormant for years, easy to forget until lease expiry approaches.

**Scope creep:** Modifications accumulate over a tenancy. That partition added in year two, the kitchen upgrade in year four, additional power points throughout—each addition increases eventual make good scope.

**Market rate changes:** Construction costs have increased significantly in recent years. Estimates from lease signing may bear little relationship to current pricing.

**Incomplete understanding:** Many tenants don't fully understand their obligations until they get professional advice.

### Estimating Your Make Good Costs

Accurate budgeting requires professional input, but rough estimates help with planning:

**Basic office spaces (minimal fit-out):** $50-100 per square metre. This covers minor repairs, repainting and cleaning for spaces with limited tenant modifications.

**Standard office fit-outs:** $150-300 per square metre. Typical for offices with partitioning, kitchen facilities and standard commercial finishes.

**Complex or high-end fit-outs:** $300-500+ per square metre. Custom joinery, extensive services modifications, high-specification finishes or structural changes push costs higher.

**Retail and hospitality:** Highly variable depending on fit-out extent. Specialised equipment, custom fixtures and heavy services installations can make retail make good particularly expensive.

**Industrial and warehouse:** Often lower per square metre but covering larger areas. Costs depend heavily on what modifications were made—a warehouse used for basic storage differs vastly from one converted for manufacturing.

For accurate figures, engage [commercial make good specialists](https://makegood.melbourne) for a detailed scope assessment and quotation.

### Factors That Influence Cost

**Original condition documentation:** Clear records of the original state reduce disputes and scope uncertainty. Poor documentation often means doing more work than strictly necessary.

**Lease terms:** Some leases specify particular requirements or standards. Others allow flexibility. Understanding your specific obligations focuses spending appropriately.

**Property age:** Older buildings may have materials requiring special handling—asbestos in particular adds significant cost and complexity.

**Access constraints:** Multi-storey buildings, shared facilities and limited loading access all increase project costs through logistics complications.

**Timeline pressure:** Rushed projects cost more. Adequate planning time allows competitive tendering and efficient scheduling.

**Market conditions:** Contractor availability and material costs fluctuate. Peak periods (December/January and June/July) often see premium pricing.

### Strategies to Manage Costs

**Start early:** Begin planning 12 months before lease expiry. This allows time for thorough scoping, competitive quotes and optimal scheduling.

**Get multiple quotes:** Three quotes from reputable contractors provide price comparison and help identify scope discrepancies.

**Negotiate with your landlord:** Some landlords accept reduced make good scope or cash settlements, particularly if they plan modifications for incoming tenants.

**Review your lease:** Understand exactly what's required. You shouldn't do more than obligated, but you must meet your commitments.

**Consider timing:** If your landlord has a new tenant ready, they may accept modified scope to expedite handover. If the property will sit vacant, they have less incentive to negotiate.

**Document everything:** Photograph original condition when moving in, modifications as you make them and final condition at exit. Documentation protects everyone.

### Building Make Good Into Business Planning

Sophisticated tenants treat make good as an ongoing business cost:

**Provision annually:** Setting aside funds each year spreads the eventual cost rather than creating a single large expense at lease end.

**Factor into fit-out decisions:** When considering modifications, include eventual removal costs in the investment analysis.

**Review at lease renewal:** Each renewal point is an opportunity to negotiate make good terms, document current condition and reset expectations.

**Consider lease alternatives:** Some landlords offer reduced make good obligations in exchange for longer lease terms or other concessions.

### When Things Go Wrong

Budget overruns typically stem from:

- Discovering hidden damage or modifications during strip-out
- Asbestos or hazardous materials requiring specialist removal
- Structural issues revealed when partitions come down
- Landlord disputes about scope or quality
- Contractor performance issues requiring remediation

Contingency allowances (typically 10-20% of estimated costs) provide buffer for unexpected issues. Complex or older properties warrant higher contingencies.

### The Bottom Line

Make good costs are a legitimate business expense that benefits from the same planning discipline as any other significant outlay. Early assessment, professional advice and adequate budgeting transform a potential crisis into a manageable process.

# POST 6: House Cleaning Services
**Submit to:** https://housecleaningservices.net.au/write-for-us/
**Title:** When Cleaning Isn't Enough: Understanding Commercial Make Good Requirements
**Author:** The Make Good Melbourne Team
**Word count:** ~750

---

Cleaning professionals often receive enquiries from commercial tenants preparing to vacate leased premises. While professional cleaning is almost always part of the lease exit process, understanding when additional make good work is required helps you advise clients appropriately and identify referral opportunities.

### The Cleaning Component

Every commercial lease exit involves cleaning. The question is whether cleaning alone satisfies the tenant's obligations:

**Lease terms matter:** Some leases specify only that premises be left "clean and tidy" or in "broom-swept condition." These tenants genuinely may need only cleaning services.

**Most leases require more:** Standard commercial leases include make good clauses requiring restoration to original or base building condition. Cleaning is necessary but not sufficient.

**Presentation vs obligation:** Even when make good works are complete, professional cleaning ensures the space presents well for landlord inspection and incoming tenant viewing.

### Recognising When More Is Needed

When assessing a potential commercial cleaning job, look for signs that make good work is also required:

**Visible modifications:** Partitions, internal walls, built-in joinery, custom kitchens or reception desks all indicate tenant modifications requiring removal.

**Holes and marks:** Screw holes, cable penetrations, mounting marks and wall damage need patching and painting—construction work, not cleaning.

**Floor covering changes:** If the tenant installed different flooring over the original, removal may be required.

**Ceiling modifications:** Extra lighting, removed tiles for cabling or custom ceiling elements indicate scope beyond cleaning.

**Signage:** External and internal signage typically must be removed with surfaces restored.

If you see these signs, the client likely needs [make good specialists](https://makegood.melbourne) before your cleaning services.

### The Right Sequence

Understanding how cleaning fits into the make good process helps you deliver better outcomes:

1. **Strip-out:** Removal of partitions, fixtures and tenant installations
2. **Repairs:** Patching, filling, plastering—addressing damage revealed during strip-out
3. **Services:** Electrical, plumbing and HVAC restoration
4. **Finishes:** Painting, floor preparation, ceiling work
5. **Builder's clean:** Removing construction debris and dust (often done by make good contractor)
6. **Final clean:** Professional deep cleaning for presentation standard

Steps 1-5 are make good works. Steps 5-6 are cleaning. Sometimes these overlap; often they're separate contracts.

### Scope Clarity Protects Everyone

When engaging with commercial lease exit clients:

**Understand the full requirement:** Ask what their lease requires. If they're unsure, suggest they seek clarification before committing to services.

**Define your scope clearly:** Specify exactly what your cleaning service includes and excludes. Commercial clients appreciate clarity.

**Identify the sequence:** Are you cleaning before, during or after make good works? This affects what's achievable and how to quote.

**Set realistic expectations:** If the space needs construction work, cleaning alone won't satisfy the landlord. Being upfront about this builds trust.

### Coordination Opportunities

Cleaning contractors who understand the make good process can add value:

**Timing coordination:** Working with make good contractors to schedule cleaning efficiently—not too early (wasting effort) or too late (delaying handover).

**Combined services:** Some cleaning businesses expand into light make good services. Others partner with construction contractors for end-to-end solutions.

**Referral relationships:** Building relationships with reputable make good specialists creates referral flows in both directions.

**Ongoing maintenance:** Tenants moving to new premises often need cleaning services there too. Good relationships during lease exit generate ongoing business.

### Adding Value Through Knowledge

Clients appreciate service providers who understand their broader situation:

**Timeline awareness:** Commercial lease exits have fixed deadlines with financial consequences for delays. Understanding this urgency helps you prioritise appropriately.

**Quality expectations:** Commercial landlords and property managers have seen many lease exits. They expect professional standards and notice substandard work.

**Documentation needs:** Some landlords require cleaning certificates or compliance documentation. Being prepared for these requests demonstrates professionalism.

### The Bigger Picture

Commercial lease exits involve multiple trades working toward a common deadline. Cleaners who understand their role in this process—and the roles of others—deliver better outcomes and build stronger client relationships.

Whether you're the final touch on a comprehensive make good project or providing standalone services for a minimal-modification tenancy, clarity about scope and sequence ensures everyone's expectations are met.
