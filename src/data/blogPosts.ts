Ending a warehouse lease in Port Melbourne doesn't have to be a nightmare. With proper planning, clear documentation and the right approach to your make good obligations, you can navigate the exit process smoothly and protect your bond. This guide breaks down everything Port Melbourne warehouse tenants need to know about end of lease requirements, from understanding what "make good" actually means to negotiating fair outcomes with landlords.

## Understanding Make Good Obligations in Port Melbourne Warehouses

### What Does "Make Good" Really Mean?

Make good is your contractual obligation to return the warehouse to the condition specified in your lease—usually matching the condition when you moved in, minus fair wear and tear. For most Port Melbourne warehouse tenants, this means:

**Common Make Good Requirements:**
- Removing racking, mezzanines and other tenant installations
- Repairing damaged concrete floors (wheel marks, gouges and chemical stains)
- Removing or repainting line marking to landlord specifications
- Disconnecting tenant electrical and plumbing installations
- Removing internal partitions or offices you've built
- Repairing damaged walls, doors and roller shutters
- Professional cleaning of the entire premises
- Waste removal and site clearance

The key is your lease agreement and the **ingoing condition report**. If you didn't get a detailed condition report with photos when you moved in, you're already at a disadvantage. That's why we always tell tenants: document everything on day one.

### Fair Wear and Tear: What You're NOT Responsible For

Here's where most disputes happen. Fair wear and tear recognises that warehouses naturally deteriorate from normal use. You shouldn't pay for:

**Normal Deterioration:**
- Light surface abrasion on concrete from normal forklift traffic
- Minor scuffing on walls from pallets
- Faded line marking from UV exposure
- Worn paint in high-traffic areas
- Natural weathering of external surfaces
- Minor cracks in old concrete (not caused by overloading)

**Damage You ARE Responsible For:**
- Deep gouges from overloaded forklifts or dropped loads
- Chemical spills that damage or stain the concrete slab
- Holes drilled without landlord approval
- Damage to roller doors from improper use
- Broken windows or damaged roof panels
- Oil stains from equipment leaks

**Pro tip:** Take dated photos of everything when you move in AND when you move out. These photos are worth their weight in gold during disputes.

## Your Port Melbourne Warehouse Exit Checklist

### 90+ Days Before Lease End

**Start Planning Now:**
- Pull out your lease and read the make good clause carefully
- Find your ingoing condition report (or note if you don't have one)
- Walk the warehouse and make a list of everything that needs addressing
- Take comprehensive photos of current condition
- Get 2-3 quotes from make good contractors familiar with Port Melbourne industrial properties

We can't stress this enough: start early. We've seen tenants leave everything until the last month and end up paying premium rates because contractors are booked out.

### 60 Days Out

**Get Your Ducks in a Row:**
- Choose your make good contractor and lock in dates
- Check if you need permits for any structural work (mezzanine removal, etc.)
- Arrange asbestos testing if your warehouse was built pre-1990
- Start negotiating with your landlord about scope of works
- Clear out equipment and inventory to allow access for contractors

### 30 Days to Go

**Execute Your Plan:**
- Major strip-out work begins (racking removal, mezzanines)
- Floor repairs and remediation
- Electrical and plumbing disconnections (must be licensed trades)
- Internal partition removal if required
- Line marking removal or repainting

### Final 14 Days

**Finishing Touches:**
- Deep clean entire warehouse
- Minor repairs and touch-ups
- Final waste removal
- Professional photos of completed works
- Schedule final inspection with landlord or property manager

## Conclusion: Success Through Preparation

Port Melbourne warehouse make good doesn't have to be stressful or blow your budget. The tenants who succeed start early, document everything and understand their lease. Contact Make Good Melbourne for expert guidance on your warehouse make good obligations.

    excerpt: "Asbestos management is critical during commercial make good works. This comprehensive guide covers identification, legal requirements, safe removal procedures and compliance documentation for Melbourne property managers and tenants.",

    content: `
Asbestos remains one of the most significant health and safety considerations in commercial make good projects across Melbourne. Buildings constructed before 1990 have a high probability of containing asbestos materials, and disturbing these during renovation or demolition works can create serious health risks and legal liabilities.

## Understanding Asbestos in Commercial Properties

### Where Asbestos Is Commonly Found

In commercial and industrial buildings, asbestos-containing materials (ACMs) were used extensively due to their fire resistance, insulation properties and durability. Common locations include:

- Ceiling tiles and acoustic panels
- Vinyl floor tiles and backing
- Pipe lagging and insulation
- Electrical switchboard backing
- Roofing materials (corrugated sheets, guttering)
- Wall sheeting (fibro cement)
- Fire doors and fire-rated partitions
- Expansion joints and gaskets

### Legal Requirements in Victoria

The Occupational Health and Safety Regulations 2017 set strict requirements for asbestos management in Victoria:

**Before Any Make Good Works:**
- An asbestos register must exist for buildings constructed before 2003
- A competent person must inspect and identify any ACMs
- Risk assessments must be completed before disturbing potential ACMs

**During Removal Works:**
- Only licensed asbestos removalists can remove friable asbestos
- Non-friable asbestos over 10 square metres requires a Class B licence
- WorkSafe Victoria must be notified before removal works commence
- Air monitoring may be required during and after removal

## Safe Asbestos Management Process

### Step 1: Identification and Testing

Before any make good works commence, engage a licensed asbestos assessor to:
- Conduct a thorough building inspection
- Take samples of suspected materials for laboratory analysis
- Provide a detailed asbestos register and management plan

### Step 2: Risk Assessment

Based on the identification results:
- Assess the condition of any ACMs found
- Determine whether materials need removal or can be managed in place
- Evaluate risks associated with planned make good works

### Step 3: Removal and Disposal

If removal is required:
- Engage appropriately licensed removal contractors
- Ensure proper containment and PPE protocols
- Dispose of waste at licensed facilities
- Obtain clearance certificates before continuing works

## Conclusion

Asbestos management is non-negotiable in commercial make good projects. The health risks are severe, and the legal penalties for non-compliance are substantial. Invest in proper identification, engage licensed professionals and maintain thorough documentation throughout the process.

    excerpt: "Professional carpet tile replacement is essential for commercial make good projects. Learn about floor preparation, installation techniques and quality standards that ensure landlord approval and bond return.",
    date: "2025-09-15",
    image: "carpet-tile-replacement.jpg",
    content: `
Carpet tile replacement is one of the most visible and impactful elements of commercial make good works. Worn, stained or damaged carpet flooring immediately signals neglect and can result in bond disputes or additional landlord claims. Professional installation on properly prepared floors ensures compliance with lease requirements and supports full security deposit return.

## Why Carpet Tiles for Commercial Spaces

Commercial carpet tiles offer significant advantages over broadloom carpet:

- **Easy replacement**: Individual damaged tiles can be replaced without affecting surrounding areas
- **Durability**: Commercial-grade tiles withstand heavy foot traffic
- **Design flexibility**: Multiple patterns and colours available for creative installations
- **Access flooring compatibility**: Tiles can be lifted for underfloor access
- **Sustainability**: Many manufacturers offer recycled and recyclable options

## Floor Preparation Standards

Proper subfloor preparation is essential for carpet tile performance and longevity:

### Concrete Subfloors

- Remove all existing floor coverings and adhesive residue
- Grind or level any high spots
- Fill cracks, holes and surface imperfections with appropriate levelling compounds
- Ensure surface is clean, dry and free of contaminants
- Apply moisture barrier if required (especially for ground-level installations)

### Raised Access Floors

- Inspect all panels for damage or instability
- Replace damaged or worn panels
- Ensure consistent panel height across the installation area
- Clean panel surfaces thoroughly

## Professional Installation Process

Quality carpet tile installation follows a systematic approach:

1. **Acclimatisation**: Tiles should be stored in the installation area for 24-48 hours before laying
2. **Layout planning**: Establish centre lines and plan tile orientation for optimal appearance
3. **Adhesive application**: Use appropriate adhesive for the specific tile backing system
4. **Tile installation**: Lay tiles systematically from the centre outward
5. **Edge trimming**: Cut border tiles precisely for clean wall junctions
6. **Final inspection**: Check for lifting, gaps or alignment issues

## Why Professional Service Matters

DIY or budget carpet installation approaches often fail to address floor preparation adequately. The result is visible defects, premature failure and make good rejection by landlords.

Our licensed and experienced team has completed thousands of square metres of commercial carpet tile installations, consistently delivering results that pass final inspections.

## Get Started

If your lease end is approaching and carpet replacement is required, contact our team early in your planning process. We'll assess your floor condition, provide detailed quotations and schedule works to align with your make good timeline.

Professional floor preparation and carpet tile installation removes the stress from one of the most visible aspects of your make good obligations, ensuring a smooth transition and full security deposit return.

    content: `
Concrete cancer, or concrete spalling, is a common but serious issue affecting commercial and industrial properties. Left untreated, it can compromise structural integrity and lead to costly repairs. Understanding the causes, identification and remediation of concrete cancer is essential for property owners and managers.

## What Is Concrete Cancer?

Concrete cancer occurs when steel reinforcement within concrete corrodes, causing the surrounding concrete to crack and break away (spall). The rust expansion can be up to ten times the volume of the original steel, creating significant internal pressure.

## Causes of Concrete Cancer

Common causes include:

- Water penetration through cracks or poor waterproofing
- Carbonation of concrete over time
- Chloride contamination (coastal environments)
- Inadequate concrete cover over reinforcement
- Poor quality original construction
- Age-related deterioration

## Identifying Concrete Cancer

Signs to watch for:

- Rust staining on concrete surfaces
