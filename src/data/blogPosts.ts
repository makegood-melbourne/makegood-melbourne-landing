Ending a warehouse lease in Port Melbourne doesn't have to be a nightmare. With proper planning, clear documentation and the right approach to your make good obligations, you can navigate the exit process smoothly and protect your bond. This guide breaks down everything Port Melbourne warehouse tenants need to know about end of lease requirements, from understanding what "make good" actually means to negotiating fair outcomes with landlords.

## Understanding Make Good Obligations in Port Melbourne Warehouses

### What Does "Make Good" Really Mean?

Make good is your contractual obligation to return the warehouse to the condition specified in your lease—usually matching the condition when you moved in, minus fair wear and tear. For most Port Melbourne warehouse tenants, this means:

**Common Make Good Requirements:**
- Removing racking, mezzanines and other tenant installations
- Repairing damaged concrete floors (wheel marks, gouges, chemical stains)
- Removing or repainting line marking to landlord specifications
- Disconnecting tenant electrical and plumbing installations
- Removing internal partitions or offices you've built
- Repairing damaged walls, doors and roller shutters
- Professional cleaning of the entire premises
- Waste removal and site clearance

The key is your lease agreement and the **ingoing condition report**. If you didn't get a detailed condition report with photos when you moved in, you're already at a disadvantage. That's why we always tell tenants: document everything on day one.

### Fair Wear and Tear: What You're NOT Responsible For

Here's where most disputes happen. Fair wear and tear recognises that warehouses naturally deteriorate from normal use. You shouldn't pay for:

**Normal Deterioration:**
- Light surface abrasion on concrete from normal forklift traffic
- Minor scuffing on walls from pallets
- Faded line marking from UV exposure
- Worn paint in high-traffic areas
- Natural weathering of external surfaces
- Minor cracks in old concrete (not caused by overloading)

**Damage You ARE Responsible For:**
- Deep gouges from overloaded forklifts or dropped loads
- Chemical spills that damage or stain the concrete slab
- Holes drilled without landlord approval
- Damage to roller doors from improper use
- Broken windows or damaged roof panels
- Oil stains from equipment leaks

**Pro tip:** Take dated photos of everything when you move in AND when you move out. These photos are worth their weight in gold during disputes.

## Your Port Melbourne Warehouse Exit Checklist

### 90+ Days Before Lease End

**Start Planning Now:**
- Pull out your lease and read the make good clause carefully
- Find your ingoing condition report (or note if you don't have one)
- Walk the warehouse and make a list of everything that needs addressing
- Take comprehensive photos of current condition
- Get 2-3 quotes from make good contractors familiar with Port Melbourne industrial properties

We can't stress this enough: start early. We've seen tenants leave everything until the last month and end up paying premium rates because contractors are booked out.

### 60 Days Out

**Get Your Ducks in a Row:**
- Choose your make good contractor and lock in dates
- Check if you need permits for any structural work (mezzanine removal, etc.)
- Arrange asbestos testing if your warehouse was built pre-1990
- Start negotiating with your landlord about scope of works
- Clear out equipment and inventory to allow access for contractors

### 30 Days to Go

**Execute Your Plan:**
- Major strip-out work begins (racking removal, mezzanines)
- Floor repairs and remediation
- Electrical and plumbing disconnections (must be licensed trades)
- Internal partition removal if required
- Line marking removal or repainting

### Final 14 Days

**Finishing Touches:**
- Deep clean entire warehouse
- Minor repairs and touch-ups
- Final waste removal
- Professional photos of completed works
- Schedule final inspection with landlord or property manager

### Make Good Component Breakdown

Here's what different warehouse components typically involve:

| Component | What's Involved | Typical Timeline | Cost Indicator |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|----------------|
| Pallet Racking | Dismantle, remove anchor bolts, patch and seal floor holes | 1-3 weeks | Moderate-High (depends on height/quantity) |
| Mezzanine Floor | Structural dismantling, engineering sign-off may be required | 2-6 weeks | High (complex work + potential permits) |
| Concrete Floor Repairs | Grinding, patching, epoxy coating or sealing | 1-2 weeks | Variable by area |
| Line Marking | Chemical removal or paint-over | 3-7 days | Low-Moderate |
| Electrical Work | Disconnect and cap-off (licensed electrician required) | 1-2 weeks | Moderate |
| Internal Offices | Demolition, removal, patch walls and ceiling | 1-2 weeks | Moderate |

## Victorian Legal Framework for Warehouse Make Good

### Know Your Rights and Obligations

**Key Victorian Legislation:**
- **Property Law Act 1958**: Governs commercial lease enforcement and dispute resolution
- **Building Act 1993**: Requires permits for structural work—including demolition
- **Environmental Protection regulations**: Controls how you dispose of waste, especially hazardous materials
- **Retail Leases Act 2003**: May apply if your warehouse includes retail components

**Why This Matters:**
You can't just start ripping out mezzanines without proper permits. We've seen tenants cop massive fines for unpermitted demolition work. If your make good involves structural changes, check permit requirements with your local council.

### Common Legal Pitfalls to Avoid

**Documentation Failures:**
- No ingoing condition report = very difficult to dispute landlord claims
- Verbal agreements mean nothing—get everything in writing
- Missing photos of completed works before handover

**Compliance Issues:**
- Using unlicensed contractors for electrical or plumbing work
- Improper asbestos handling in older warehouses
- Illegal waste disposal (especially chemicals, oils or construction waste)

**Timing Mistakes:**
- Holding over beyond lease end without agreement (expensive!)
- Starting works before landlord approval of scope
- Missing permit applications that delay completion

If your landlord is claiming tens of thousands in make good costs that seem unreasonable, get legal advice. A property lawyer can review whether claims are valid under Victorian law.

## Negotiation Strategies That Actually Work

### Three Exit Strategy Options

**1. Full Reinstatement (Traditional Make Good)**
You do all the physical works to return the warehouse to its original condition.

**When This Works Best:**
- Clear lease requirements with detailed condition report
- Landlord insists on physical works
- You want certainty of final costs
- No time pressure on handover

**2. Cash Settlement (Negotiated Buy-Out)**
Pay the landlord a lump sum instead of doing the works yourself.

**When This Works Best:**
- You need quick exit
- Minor works only
- Landlord prefers cash to manage works themselves
- You can negotiate a fair settlement amount

**3. Negotiated Retention (Keep Some Fixtures)**
Landlord agrees to keep some of your installations (racking, offices, etc.) and adjust settlement accordingly.

**When This Works Best:**
- Incoming tenant wants your fitout
- Landlord planning to re-let to similar use
- Items are valuable and in good condition
- Can reduce your costs significantly

### How to Negotiate Effectively

**Come Prepared with Evidence:**
- Detailed condition reports (ingoing vs current)
- Independent dilapidation reports from qualified assessors
- Competitive quotes from reputable contractors
- Market research on local vacancy rates and re-letting demand

**Use Market Conditions to Your Advantage:**
If Port Melbourne warehouse vacancy is high (which varies with the economy), landlords may be more flexible because they need to attract the next tenant quickly. If the market is tight, you have less leverage.

**Make Reasonable Offers:**
Lowball offers insult landlords and kill negotiations. If independent quotes show $30,000 in legitimate make good works, don't offer $5,000. A fair offer might be $25,000-$28,000 accounting for fair wear and tear.

**Document Everything:**
Get any agreed variations to make good scope in writing, signed by both parties. Ideally as a formal deed of variation to the lease.

### When to Bring in Experts

**Engage Professionals When:**
- Make good disputes exceed $15,000-$20,000
- Lease terms are ambiguous or contradictory
- Landlord discovers hazardous materials and assigns costs to you
- Structural work requires engineering reports
- You're being held over and accruing additional rent

A good property lawyer or quantity surveyor can often save you more than their fees.

## Port Melbourne's 2025 Industrial Market Context

### Why Location Matters

Port Melbourne's industrial property market has unique characteristics that affect make good negotiations:

**High Demand Area:**
- Proximity to Port of Melbourne and Melbourne CBD
- Strong logistics and distribution sector
- Limited available land for new industrial development
- Premium rents compared to outer suburbs

**Market Dynamics:**
When vacancy rates are low, landlords have more leverage—they know they can re-let quickly. But they also know incoming tenants often want existing fitouts like racking and offices, which can work in your favour if you negotiate retention.

### 2025 Market Trends Affecting Make Good

**Sustainability Focus:**
More landlords are interested in environmentally responsible make good practices:
- Recycling materials where possible (especially steel racking)
- Proper waste sorting and disposal documentation
- Solar panel retention for next tenant
- Energy-efficient lighting upgrades

Positioning your make good as "green" can be a negotiation advantage.

**Fitout Retention Appetite:**
We're seeing more landlords willing to keep quality tenant fitouts because:
- New tenants prefer "plug and play" warehouses
- Building new fitouts is expensive and time-consuming
- Existing racking and mezzanines add value if in good condition

**Compliance Scrutiny:**
Landlords are more careful about compliance documentation:
- Want proof of licensed contractors for all trades
- Require waste disposal receipts
- Want asbestos clearance certificates for older buildings
- EPA documentation for hazardous waste removal

## Finding the Right Make Good Contractors in Port Melbourne

### Essential Selection Criteria

**Must-Haves:**
- **Current public liability insurance** (minimum $10-20 million for warehouse work)
- **WorkCover/workers' compensation** coverage
- **Demonstrated warehouse experience** with verifiable references
- **Licensed trades** for electrical, plumbing and any structural work
- **Proper waste handling** capabilities and EPA compliance
- **Knowledge of Port Melbourne access** and local requirements

**Red Flags to Avoid:**
- Cash-only operators
- No insurance or expired coverage
- Can't provide references
- Suspiciously low quotes (usually means shortcuts or hidden extras)
- No written scope of works or contract

### Questions to Ask Contractors

1. "Have you completed make good work in Port Melbourne warehouses before?" (Ask for addresses and references)
2. "What's your typical timeline for similar-sized projects?"
3. "How do you handle waste disposal and what documentation will you provide?"
4. "Are all your tradespeople licensed? Can I see copies?"
5. "What happens if the landlord rejects the works at final inspection?"
6. "Will you provide photos of completed work before the landlord inspection?"

**Get Everything in Writing:**
- Detailed scope of works matching lease requirements
- Fixed price (or clear schedule of rates)
- Timeline with milestones
- Payment schedule (never pay everything upfront)
- Defects liability period
- Certificates and documentation to be provided

### Local Considerations

**Port Melbourne Access:**
- Council restrictions on waste removal times
- Parking permits for contractor vehicles
- Noise restrictions in mixed-use areas
- Coordination with neighbouring businesses

Good contractors know these local rules. If they don't ask about site access, that's a warning sign.

## Cost Management and Budgeting

### Realistic Port Melbourne Warehouse Make Good Costs

Costs vary wildly depending on warehouse size, fitout complexity and condition. Here are rough guides for 2025:

**Small Warehouse (200-500m²):**
- Basic make good (clean, minor repairs): $5,000-$15,000
- Standard make good (racking removal, repairs, repaint): $15,000-$35,000
- Extensive make good (mezzanine, major floor work): $35,000-$70,000+

**Medium Warehouse (500-1,500m²):**
- Basic make good: $15,000-$40,000
- Standard make good: $40,000-$90,000
- Extensive make good: $90,000-$200,000+

**Large Warehouse (1,500m²+):**
- Costs scale proportionally but can hit $300,000+ for complex fitouts

**Hidden Cost Factors:**
- Asbestos removal (pre-1990 buildings): Add $10,000-$50,000+
- Structural engineering reports: $2,000-$5,000
- Permit fees: $500-$3,000
- Waste disposal: $200-$400 per ton
- Holding over rent if you overrun: Your monthly rent converted to daily rate

### Protecting Your Bond

Most commercial leases hold substantial security deposits. Here's how to get it all back:

**Document Everything:**
- Photos of condition when you moved in
- Photos throughout your tenancy showing maintenance
- Photos of completed make good works
- All contractor invoices and certificates
- Waste disposal receipts
- Asbestos clearance certificates if applicable

**Get Sign-Off Before Vacating:**
- Schedule practical completion inspection with landlord
- Walk through together making a list of any issues
- Fix any legitimate defects immediately
- Get written confirmation that make good is complete
- Only then hand over keys

**Dispute Process:**
If the landlord tries to claim excessive costs from your bond:
1. Request detailed breakdown with quotes
2. Compare to your documentation
3. Challenge unreasonable claims in writing
4. Seek independent assessment if needed
5. Consider VCAT (Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal) for unresolved disputes

## Common Port Melbourne Warehouse Make Good Scenarios

### Case Study: 1,200m² Logistics Warehouse, Fishermans Bend

**The Situation:**
Tenant had installed extensive racking system, mezzanine office, epoxy floor coating in packing area and upgraded lighting throughout. Lease required return to "base building" condition.

**The Solution:**
- Negotiated to leave upgraded LED lighting (incoming tenant wanted it)
- Landlord accepted cash settlement for epoxy coating removal ($8,000 vs $15,000 to physically remove)
- Carefully dismantled and removed racking and mezzanine
- Repaired floor anchor bolt holes
- Professional clean

**Outcome:** Total cost $65,000 vs initial landlord estimate of $95,000. Full bond returned.

### Case Study: 600m² Manufacturing Warehouse, Port Melbourne Industrial Estate

**The Situation:**
Tenant discovered asbestos in ceiling panels during initial strip-out. Lease didn't specify who pays for pre-existing asbestos.

**The Solution:**
- Stopped work immediately and engaged licensed asbestos assessor
- Negotiated with landlord on cost-sharing (landlord's building, tenant's obligation to remove)
- Reached 50/50 split arrangement
- Licensed Class A removal contractor engaged
- Clearance certificate obtained before continuing

**Outcome:** 3-week project delay but avoided legal dispute. Cost split saved tenant $18,000.

    content: `Asbestos-containing materials (ACMs) remain present in many commercial buildings constructed before 2004, presenting serious health risks if disturbed during make good or demolition works. Professional asbestos management is not optional—it's a legal requirement that protects workers, building occupants and the broader community from exposure to this dangerous substance. This comprehensive guide explores asbestos identification, assessment, removal requirements and integration with commercial make good projects in Melbourne.

## Understanding Asbestos in Commercial Buildings

### What is Asbestos?

Asbestos refers to a group of naturally occurring fibrous minerals that were widely used in Australian construction materials from the 1940s through to the mid-1980s, with some products containing asbestos imported until 2004 when a total ban came into effect.

**Why It Was Used:**
- Excellent fire resistance and heat insulation
- Durability and resistance to chemical attack
- Sound absorption properties
- Low cost and easy installation
- Versatility in many building applications

**The Health Risks:**
- Asbestosis (lung scarring)
- Lung cancer
- Mesothelioma (cancer of lung and abdominal lining)
- Diseases typically develop 20-40 years after exposure
- No safe level of exposure—any fibre inhalation is dangerous

### Common Asbestos Locations in Commercial Buildings

Buildings constructed or refurbished before 2004 may contain asbestos in:

**Bonded (Non-Friable) Asbestos:**
- Cement sheeting (internal and external walls)
- Roofing and guttering (corrugated and flat sheets)
- Eaves, fascias and soffits
- Vinyl floor tiles and backing
- Switchboard backing panels
- Fire doors
- Signage and notice boards

**Friable Asbestos** (higher risk—can crumble to dust):
- Pipe lagging and thermal insulation
- Boiler and plant insulation
- Spray-on fire protection coatings
- Ceiling tiles and panels
- Millboard around heaters and stoves
- Loose fill insulation

**Hidden Locations Often Found During Make Good:**
- Behind wall linings
- Above suspended ceilings
- Within service risers
- Under floor coverings
- Linoleum backing
- Carpet underlay
- Electrical cable insulation
- Expansion joints
- Bitumen roofing membranes

## Asbestos Identification and Assessment

### Asbestos Register and Management Plan

**Legal Requirement:**
Under Victorian and Commonwealth regulations, every commercial property must have an **Asbestos Register** documenting:
- Location of known or suspected ACMs
- Type and condition of materials
- Risk assessment
- Management recommendations

**Duty to Manage Asbestos:**
Building owners and employers have legal duty to:
- Identify asbestos in their buildings
- Maintain asbestos register
- Ensure register is available to workers
- Implement control measures
- Review register regularly

**Before Any Make Good Works:**
- Review existing asbestos register
- Conduct asbestos survey if register absent or inadequate
- Provide register to all contractors
- Ensure contractors understand ACM locations
- Plan works to avoid disturbing asbestos

### Asbestos Surveys and Testing

**When Survey Required:**
- No current asbestos register exists
- Register is outdated or inadequate
- Building modifications planned
- Demolition or refurbishment works intended
- Suspected ACMs discovered during works
- Due diligence for property transactions

**Types of Asbestos Surveys:**

**1. Asbestos Management Survey (non-intrusive):**
- Visual inspection of readily accessible areas
- Presumptive identification of suspected ACMs
- Sampling and laboratory analysis of materials
- Risk assessment and management recommendations
- Suitable for occupied buildings and routine management

**2. Asbestos Refurbishment/Demolition Survey (intrusive):**
- Comprehensive inspection including concealed areas
- Destructive inspection methods if required
- Sampling of all suspected materials
- Full documentation for demolition/refurbishment planning
- Building should be unoccupied
- Required before significant demolition or refurbishment

**Qualified Asbestos Assessor:**
- Only licensed/competent asbestos assessors can conduct surveys
- Independent assessor (not removal contractor) preferred
- Provide detailed report with photos, plans and recommendations

**Laboratory Analysis:**
- Samples analysed by NATA-accredited laboratory
- Identifies asbestos type and percentage
- Results typically available within 3-7 days
- Costs approximately $50-80 per sample

### Visual Identification (Presumptive)

**WARNING**: Never assume material is asbestos-free based on visual inspection alone. Only laboratory testing confirms presence or absence of asbestos.

**Indicators of Potential ACMs:**
- Cement sheet with characteristic appearance and date stamp
- Age of building (pre-1990 high risk)
- Textured ceiling coatings in older buildings
- Old vinyl floor tiles 300mm x 300mm
- Insulation on older pipes and ducts

**DO NOT:**
- Disturb suspected materials
- Take samples unless trained and licensed
- Assume materials are safe without testing
- Rely on material labels (often incorrect or missing)

## Legal Requirements and Compliance

### Victorian and Commonwealth Legislation

## Integration with Make Good Projects

### Pre-Demolition Asbestos Assessment

**Critical First Step:**
Before any make good demolition or strip-out works commence, asbestos assessment must be completed:

1. **Review Asbestos Register**: Check for known ACMs in work area
2. **Refurbishment/Demolition Survey**: If inadequate register, conduct full survey
3. **Laboratory Testing**: Confirm suspected materials
4. **Removal Planning**: Engage licensed removalists
5. **Removal Completion**: Obtain clearance certificate
6. **Proceed with Make Good**: Only after clearance issued

**Timeline Impact:**
- Asbestos survey: 1-3 days plus 5-7 days lab results
- Removal planning and notification: 5+ days
- Removal works: 1-5 days depending on extent
- Clearance inspection and air monitoring: 1-2 days
- Total asbestos phase: 2-3 weeks minimum

### Common Make Good Scenarios Involving Asbestos

**Ceiling Removal:**
- Acoustic ceiling tiles may contain asbestos
- Ceiling panel backing boards
- Fireproofing materials above ceilings

### Asbestos Discovered During Works

**STOP WORK IMMEDIATELY:**
If suspected asbestos is discovered during make good works:

1. **Stop all work** in affected area
2. **Evacuate workers** from immediate area
3. **Secure area** - prevent entry
4. **Notify building management** and WorkSafe (if exposure occurred)
5. **Arrange assessment** by licensed asbestos assessor
6. **Laboratory testing** to confirm presence
7. **Licensed removal** if confirmed
8. **Clearance certificate** before resuming works

**Worker Exposure:**
- Workers potentially exposed must be informed
- Medical assessment arranged if significant exposure
- Incident reported to WorkSafe
- Document exposure for workers' records

### Cost Implications

**Asbestos Management Costs:**
- Asbestos survey: $800-$2,500 depending on building size
- Laboratory testing: $50-80 per sample
- Licensed removal (bonded): $80-150 per m² plus waste disposal
- Licensed removal (friable): $200-500+ per m² plus waste disposal
- Air monitoring: $800-$1,500 per area
- Clearance inspection: $500-$1,200

**Impact on Make Good Budget:**
Asbestos removal can significantly increase make good costs, particularly:
- Older buildings with extensive ACMs
- Unexpected asbestos discoveries
- Friable asbestos requiring Class A removal
- Large areas requiring containment
- Disposal costs for large quantities

**Landlord vs Tenant Responsibility:**
- Lease terms typically dictate responsibility

## Conclusion

Asbestos management is a critical, non-negotiable component of commercial make good projects in older buildings. The serious health risks, stringent legal requirements and severe penalties for non-compliance make professional asbestos assessment and licensed removal essential. Cutting corners on asbestos management endangers lives, exposes parties to massive liability and can derail entire make good projects.

Successful asbestos management requires early assessment, licensed removal specialists, full compliance with regulations and integration into the overall make good project plan. The costs of proper asbestos management are a necessary investment in safety, compliance and project success.

When it comes to end of lease make good obligations, carpet tile replacement and installation is one of the most visible elements that determines whether a tenancy is returned to its original condition. Professional floor preparation is critical to achieving a uniform, compliant finish that meets lease requirements.

## The Importance of Proper Floor Preparation

Many carpet tile installations fail because the underlying floor surface hasn't been properly prepared. Residual glue, uneven surfaces and contamination can all compromise the installation quality and longevity of new carpet tiles.

Our comprehensive approach ensures your floor is ready for a perfect installation that will pass the most stringent landlord inspections.

## Floor Grinding: The Foundation of Quality Installation

We provide comprehensive grinding of the floor surface to ensure uniform installation. This process involves:

### Surface Leveling
Professional grinding equipment removes high spots and creates a level substrate. An uneven floor will cause carpet tiles to lift, curl or wear unevenly over time.

### Glue Removal
Complete removal of residual adhesive from previous flooring installations is essential. Old glue can prevent new adhesive from bonding properly and create visible irregularities through the carpet tiles.

### Surface Preparation
Grinding opens the concrete pores, creating an ideal surface for adhesive bonding. This ensures carpet tiles remain securely in place throughout the new tenancy period.

### Contamination Elimination
The grinding process removes oil, paint, sealers and other contaminants that could interfere with adhesive performance or cause staining through the new carpet.

## Professional Installation Standards

Following thorough floor preparation, our installation process includes:

### Moisture Testing
Concrete floors are tested for moisture levels that could compromise adhesive bonding or damage carpet tiles over time.

### Layout Planning
Tiles are carefully planned to minimise cuts, maximise symmetry and ensure consistent pattern alignment throughout the space.

### Quality Adhesive Application
We use commercial-grade pressure-sensitive adhesives specifically formulated for carpet tile installation, ensuring reliable bonding without damaging the substrate.

### Precision Installation
Each tile is carefully placed, aligned and rolled to ensure proper adhesive contact and eliminate air pockets.

## End of Lease Compliance

Carpet tile replacement is often a major component of make good obligations. Our installation service ensures:

- Matching or equivalent tile specifications to original installation
- Uniform appearance and professional finish
- Documentation of work completed for landlord approval
- Compliance with lease make good requirements

Our commercial flooring team is equipped with:

- Commercial-grade diamond grinding equipment
- HEPA-filtered dust extraction
- Moisture testing to AS/NZS standards
- Pressure-sensitive adhesive systems
- Pattern matching and alignment
- Edge trimming and transition installation

## Project Scheduling

Floor preparation and carpet installation requires careful timing:

1. **Floor Assessment**: Initial inspection and specification confirmation
2. **Grinding Phase**: Typically 1-2 days depending on area size
3. **Curing Period**: 24-48 hours for floor to stabilise
4. **Installation**: Usually 1-2 days for standard office spaces
5. **Final Inspection**: Walk-through and documentation

## Cost Considerations

While comprehensive floor preparation adds to project cost, it protects against:

- Failed installations requiring costly replacement
- Landlord rejection of make good works
- Security deposit withholding
- Legal disputes over tenancy condition

Professional preparation is an investment in compliance and peace of mind.

## Environmental Considerations

Our floor preparation process includes:

- Dust containment and HEPA filtration
- Responsible disposal of removed materials
- Low-VOC adhesive systems
- Recycling of packaging materials

## Why Professional Service Matters

DIY or budget carpet installation approaches often fail to address floor preparation adequately. The result is visible defects, premature failure and make good rejection by landlords.
