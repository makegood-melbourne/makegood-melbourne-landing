      "name": "What is a make good clause in a commercial lease?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "A make good clause sets out what you're required to do when your lease ends. Usually that means removing your fitout, repairing damage and returning the space to its original condition. Every lease is different—read yours carefully."
      }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "What is the difference between make good and make safe?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Make good is planned work at the end of a lease—restoring the space as required by your agreement. Make safe is urgent work after an incident—fire, flood, impact damage. It's about eliminating hazards and securing the site quickly."
      }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "What does a make good typically include?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Removing tenant-installed partitions, signage and fixtures. Patching and painting walls. Reinstating ceilings and floors. Disconnecting and certifying electrical, data and mechanical services. For warehouses, it often includes racking removal and concrete floor repairs."
      }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "What is a make good and when is it required?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "A make good is the process of returning a commercial space to its original or agreed condition at lease end. Most commercial leases have a make good clause. It's triggered when you vacate—whether at lease end, early termination or break clause."
      }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Who is responsible for make good requirements?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "The tenant. In almost all commercial leases, you're responsible for the work and the cost. Check your lease to understand exactly what's required."
      }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "What happens if I don't complete my make good?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "The landlord can complete the work and bill you—usually at a premium. You may lose part or all of your bond. In some cases, they'll pursue legal action. Better to deal with it yourself."
      }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "How much does a make good cost in Melbourne?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "It depends on size and scope. Office make goods typically run $100–$200 per square metre. Industrial spaces are often less. We quote after a site inspection—fixed price, no surprises."
      }

      "name": "Who pays for the make good—tenant or landlord?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "The tenant. In almost all commercial leases, you cover the cost."

      "name": "Can I negotiate my make good costs with the landlord?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Yes. Some landlords will accept a cash settlement instead of physical works—especially if they're planning to refurbish anyway. Others may agree to a reduced scope. We can help you work through the options."
      }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "How can I reduce my make good costs?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Plan early. Get a clear scope agreed with your landlord before work starts. Negotiate what actually needs reinstating. And get it done right the first time—rework is expensive."
      }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Do you price match or have a price promise?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",

      "name": "What's the difference between a quote and an estimate?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "An estimate is a rough guess that can change. A quote is a fixed price for a defined scope. We provide fixed-price quotes. Once we agree on the scope, the price is locked."

    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "How long does a make good take?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Small office strip-out: 1–2 weeks. Large warehouse restoration: 4–8 weeks. It depends on size, complexity and coordination with the landlord."

      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "When should I start planning my make good?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "At least 3–6 months before your lease ends. That gives you time for inspections, scope agreement, quotes and scheduling without rushing."

      "name": "What is your make good process?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "1. Free consultation—we review your lease and inspect the site. 2. Detailed quote—fixed price, no surprises. 3. Scope agreement—we finalise requirements with you and the landlord. 4. Execution—we complete the work to the agreed standard. 5. Documentation and handover—full records, final inspection coordinated."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",

      }
    },

      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Do I need to be on site for the quote inspection?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Helpful, but not essential. We can coordinate access with your building manager. Having someone who knows the site available helps us understand your requirements."

      "name": "What is building remediation and when is it needed?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Remediation is rectifying defects or damage—structural issues, water ingress, concrete spalling and cracking. It's needed when the problem affects the building's safety, integrity or compliance."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Your lease agreement (especially the make good clause ), property address, approximate floor area and any landlord requirements. If you don't have everything, we'll work with what you have and clarify the rest on site."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "You can try, but it's not recommended. Landlords usually require licensed trades for electrical, plumbing and fire safety work. You'll need proper documentation and compliance certificates. A poor job leads to disputes and extra costs."
