      "name": "What is a make good and when is it required?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "A make good is the process of returning a commercial space to its original or agreed condition at lease end. Most commercial leases include a make good clause that defines what's required. It's triggered when you vacate—whether at lease end, early termination or break clause."
      }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "What is a make good clause in a commercial lease?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "A make good clause sets out what you're required to do when your lease ends. Usually that means removing your fitout, repairing damage and returning the space to its original condition. Every lease is different—read yours carefully and understand your obligations before signing."
      }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Who is responsible for make good requirements?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "The tenant is responsible. In almost all commercial leases, you're responsible for both the work and the cost. Check your lease to understand exactly what's required and plan accordingly."
      }

      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "What happens if I don't complete my make good?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "The landlord can complete the work and bill you—usually at a premium. You may lose part or all of your bond. In some cases, they'll pursue legal action for additional costs. It's better to deal with it yourself and control the outcome."
      }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "How much does a make good cost in Melbourne?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "It depends on size and scope. Office make goods typically run $100–$200 per square metre. Industrial spaces are often less due to simpler finishes. We quote after a site inspection—fixed price, no surprises."
      }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Who pays for the make good—tenant or landlord?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "The tenant pays. In almost all commercial leases, you cover the cost of returning the space to its original condition. This is typically outlined in your make good clause."

    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "How can I reduce my make good costs?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Plan early. Get a clear scope agreed with your landlord before work starts. Negotiate what actually needs reinstating—some items may be acceptable to leave. And get it done right the first time—rework is expensive."
      }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "When should I start planning my make good?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "At least 3–6 months before your lease ends. That gives you time for inspections, scope agreement, quotes and scheduling without rushing. Starting early also gives you leverage in negotiations with your landlord."
      }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "How long does a make good take?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Small office strip-out: 1–2 weeks. Large warehouse restoration: 4–8 weeks. It depends on size, complexity and coordination with the landlord. We'll give you a realistic timeline during the quoting process."
      }

      "name": "Do you provide free quotes?",

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "1. Free consultation—we review your lease and inspect the site. 2. Detailed quote—fixed price, no surprises. 3. Scope agreement—we finalise requirements with you and the landlord. 4. Execution—we complete the work to the agreed standard. 5. Documentation and handover—full records, final inspection coordinated."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Your lease agreement (especially the make good clause), property address, approximate floor area and any landlord requirements. If you don't have everything, we'll work with what you have and clarify the rest during the site inspection."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Removing tenant-installed partitions, signage and fixtures. Patching and painting walls. Reinstating ceilings and floors. Disconnecting and certifying electrical, data and mechanical services. For warehouses, it often includes racking removal and concrete floor repairs."
      }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Can you work outside business hours?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Yes, when required. After-hours work is often necessary in occupied buildings or retail environments where daytime disruption isn't acceptable. We'll discuss scheduling options during the quoting process."
      }
    },

      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Do you handle make safe or urgent works?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Yes—during business hours. We secure sites after fire, flood or impact damage. We eliminate hazards and make the property safe to prevent further damage. We don't offer 24/7 emergency call-outs."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Make good is planned work at the end of a lease—restoring the space as required by your agreement. Make safe is urgent work after an incident—fire, flood or impact damage. Make safe is about eliminating hazards and securing the site quickly to prevent further damage."

      "name": "What is building remediation and when is it needed?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Remediation is rectifying defects or damage—structural issues, water ingress, concrete spalling and cracking. It's needed when the problem affects the building's safety, integrity or compliance with regulations."

      "name": "My building has water leaks—can you fix them?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Yes. We find the source, repair the damage and restore affected areas. Our waterproofing services address the root cause to prevent recurrence. Water damage left untreated leads to bigger structural problems."

      "name": "Does my building need cladding rectification?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "If your building has combustible cladding, it may not meet current fire safety standards. We can assess the situation and advise on removal and replacement with compliant materials to meet regulatory requirements."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Before and after photos, compliance certificates, electrical and fire safety test reports, waste disposal receipts and a final handover checklist. Everything you need for a clean handover and to demonstrate the work was completed to standard."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "We don't have a public phone number or office. Contact us via email at info@makegood.melbourne and we respond during business hours. This keeps our overheads low and our prices competitive."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Yes, negotiation is common. Some landlords will accept a cash settlement instead of physical works—especially if they're planning to refurbish anyway. Others may agree to a reduced scope. We can help you work through the options and present them professionally."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "No, we don't compete on price. We provide fair, fixed-price quotes based on quality work, licensed trades and proper project management. Our focus is on getting the job done right, not being the cheapest option."
      }

    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "What's the difference between a quote and an estimate?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "An estimate is a rough guess that can change as the project progresses. A quote is a fixed price for a defined scope of work. We provide fixed-price quotes—once we agree on the scope, the price is locked."
      }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Do I need to be on site for the quote inspection?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Helpful, but not essential. We can coordinate access with your building manager or agent. Having someone who knows the site available helps us understand your specific requirements and any access considerations."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Agree on a clear scope in writing before work starts—that's the best way to prevent disputes. If one arises, our documentation—photos, certificates and records—demonstrates the work was completed to the agreed standard."

      "name": "What happens if the make good isn't completed on time?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Holdover rent—often significantly higher than standard rent. Landlords may also claim damages for the delay. We schedule carefully and build in contingency to finish on time and avoid these penalties."
      }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Can I do my own make good instead of hiring professionals?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "You can try, but it's not recommended. Landlords usually require licensed trades for electrical, plumbing and fire safety work. You'll need proper documentation and compliance certificates. A poor job leads to disputes, rework and extra costs."
      }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Do you guarantee that my bond will be returned?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "No—that's the landlord's decision and depends on many factors. Our job is to complete the work to the required standard and provide documentation that supports a successful handover."
