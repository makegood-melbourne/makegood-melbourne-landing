# WORKFLOW RULES

## **MANDATORY PROCESS FOR ALL DEPLOYMENTS**

1.  **READ THESE RULES:** At the start of every session, you MUST read and acknowledge these rules.
2.  **NEVER PUSH TO MAIN:** All changes MUST be pushed to a `test` branch first.
3.  **PROVIDE PREVIEW:** You MUST provide a preview link from the `test` branch for me to review.
4.  **AWAIT APPROVAL:** You MUST NOT merge to `main` (production) until you receive explicit approval from me.
5.  **CONFIRM COMPLETION:** After deploying to production, you MUST provide confirmation that the changes are live.
